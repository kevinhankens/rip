  # Active Record objects doesn't specify their attributes directly, but rather infer them from the table definition with
  # which they're linked. Adding, removing, and changing attributes and their type is done directly in the database. Any change
  # is instantly reflected in the Active Record objects. The mapping that binds a given Active Record class to a certain
  # database table will happen automatically in most common cases, but can be overwritten for the uncommon ones. 
  # 
  # See the mapping rules in table_name and the full example in link:files/README.html for more insight.
  # 
  # == Creation
  # 
  # Active Records accepts constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block. The hash method is especially useful when
  # you're receiving the data from somewhere else, like a HTTP request. It works like this:
  # 
  #   user = User.new("name" => "David", "occupation" => "Code Artist")
  #   user.name # => "David"
  # 
  # You can also use block initialization:
  # 
  #   user = User.new do |u|
  #     u.name = "David"
  #     u.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #   end
  # 
  # And of course you can just create a bare object and specify the attributes after the fact:
  # 
  #   user = User.new
  #   user.name = "David"
  #   user.occupation = "Code Artist"
  # 
  # == Conditions
  # 
  # Conditions can either be specified as a string or an array representing the WHERE-part of an SQL statement.
  # The array form is to be used when the condition input is tainted and requires sanitization. The string form can
  # be used for statements that doesn't involve tainted data. Examples:
  # 
  #   User < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def self.authenticate_unsafely(user_name, password)
  #       find_first("user_name = '#{user_name}' AND password = '#{password}'")
  #     end
  # 
  #     def self.authenticate_safely(user_name, password)
  #       find_first([ "user_name = ? AND password = ?", user_name, password ])
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # The <tt>authenticate_unsafely</tt> method inserts the parameters directly into the query and is thus susceptible to SQL-injection
  # attacks if the <tt>user_name</tt> and +password+ parameters come directly from a HTTP request. The <tt>authenticate_safely</tt> method, 
  # on the other hand, will sanitize the <tt>user_name</tt> and +password+ before inserting them in the query, which will ensure that
  # an attacker can't escape the query and fake the login (or worse).
  #
  # == Overwriting default accessors
  # 
  # All column values are automatically available through basic accessors on the Active Record object, but some times you
  # want to specialize this behavior. This can be done by either by overwriting the default accessors (using the same
  # name as the attribute) calling read_attribute(attr_name) and write_attribute(attr_name, value) to actually change things.
  # Example:
  # 
  #   class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song
  #     
  #     def length=(minutes)
  #       write_attribute("length", minutes * 60)
  #     end
  #     
  #     def length
  #       read_attribute("length") / 60
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # == Dynamic attribute-based finders
  #
  # Dynamic attribute-based finders are a cleaner way of getting objects by simple queries without turning to SQL. They work by
  # appending the name of an attribute to <tt>find_by_</tt>, so you get finders like <tt>Person.find_by_user_name, Payment.find_by_transaction_id</tt>.
  # So instead of writing <tt>Person.find_first(["user_name = ?", user_name])</tt>, you just do <tt>Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)</tt>.
  # 
  # It's also possible to use multiple attributes in the same find by separating them with "_and_", so you get finders like
  # <tt>Person.find_by_user_name_and_password</tt> or even <tt>Payment.find_by_purchaser_and_state_and_country</tt>. So instead of writing
  # <tt>Person.find_first(["user_name = ? AND password = ?", user_name, password])</tt>, you just do 
  # <tt>Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password)</tt>.
  # 
  # It's even possible to use all the additional parameters to find_first and find_all. For example, the full interface for Payment.find_all_by_amount
  # is actually Payment.find_all_by_amount(amount, orderings = nil, limit = nil, joins = nil). And the full interface to Person.find_by_user_name is
  # actually Person.find_by_user_name(user_name, orderings = nil)
  #
  # == Saving arrays, hashes, and other non-mappeable objects in text columns
  # 
  # Active Record can serialize any object in text columns using YAML. To do so, you must specify this with a call to the class method +serialize+. 
  # This makes it possible to store arrays, hashes, and other non-mappeable objects without doing any additional work. Example:
  # 
  #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     serialize :preferences
  #   end
  # 
  #   user = User.create("preferences" => { "background" => "black", "display" => large })
  #   User.find(user.id).preferences # => { "background" => "black", "display" => large }
  # 
  # You can also specify an class option as the second parameter that'll raise an exception if a serialized object is retrieved as a 
  # descendent of a class not in the hierarchy. Example:
  # 
  #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     serialize :preferences, Hash
  #   end
  # 
  #   user = User.create("preferences" => %w( one two three ))
  #   User.find(user.id).preferences    # raises SerializationTypeMismatch
  # 
  # == Single table inheritance
  #
  # Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a column that by default is called "type" (can be changed 
  # by overwriting <tt>Base.inheritance_column</tt>). This means that an inheritance looking like this:
  #
  #   class Company < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  #   class Firm < Company; end
  #   class Client < Company; end
  #   class PriorityClient < Client; end
  #
  # When you do Firm.create("name" => "37signals"), this record with be saved in the companies table with type = "Firm". You can then
  # fetch this row again using Company.find_first "name = '37signals'" and it will return a Firm object.
  #
  # If you don't have a type column defined in your table, single-table inheritance won't be triggered. In that case, it'll work just
  # like normal subclasses with no special magic for differentiating between them or reloading the right type with find.
  #
  # Note, all the attributes for all the cases are kept in the same table. Read more:
  # http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html
  # 
  # == Connection to multiple databases in different models
  #
  # Connections are usually created through ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection and retrieved by ActiveRecord::Base.connection.
  # All classes inheriting from ActiveRecord::Base will use this connection. But you can also set a class-specific connection. 
  # For example, if Course is a ActiveRecord::Base, but resides in a different database you can just say Course.establish_connection
  # and Course *and all its subclasses* will use this connection instead.
  #
  # This feature is implemented by keeping a connection pool in ActiveRecord::Base that is a Hash indexed by the class. If a connection is
  # requested, the retrieve_connection method will go up the class-hierarchy until a connection is found in the connection pool.
  #
  # == Exceptions
  # 
  # * +ActiveRecordError+ -- generic error class and superclass of all other errors raised by Active Record
  # * +AdapterNotSpecified+ -- the configuration hash used in <tt>establish_connection</tt> didn't include a 
  #   <tt>:adapter</tt> key.
  # * +AdapterNotSpecified+ -- the <tt>:adapter</tt> key used in <tt>establish_connection</tt> specified an unexisting adapter
  #   (or a bad spelling of an existing one). 
  # * +AssociationTypeMismatch+ -- the object assigned to the association wasn't of the type specified in the association definition. 
  # * +SerializationTypeMismatch+ -- the object serialized wasn't of the class specified as the second parameter. 
  # * +ConnectionNotEstablished+ -- no connection has been established. Use <tt>establish_connection</tt> before querying.
  # * +RecordNotFound+ -- no record responded to the find* method. 
  #   Either the row with the given ID doesn't exist or the row didn't meet the additional restrictions.
  # * +StatementInvalid+ -- the database server rejected the SQL statement. The precise error is added in the  message.
  #   Either the record with the given ID doesn't exist or the record didn't meet the additional restrictions.
  # 
  # *Note*: The attributes listed are class-level attributes (accessible from both the class and instance level). 
  # So it's possible to assign a logger to the class through Base.logger= which will then be used by all
  # instances in the current object space.
  class Base
    include ClassInheritableAttributes
  
    # Accepts a logger conforming to the interface of Log4r or the default Ruby 1.8+ Logger class, which is then passed
    # on to any new database connections made and which can be retrieved on both a class and instance level by calling +logger+.

      # Guesses the table name (in forced lower-case) based on the name of the class in the inheritance hierarchy descending
      # directly from ActiveRecord. So if the hierarchy looks like: Reply < Message < ActiveRecord, then Message is used
      # to guess the table name from even when called on Reply. The guessing rules are as follows:
      #
      # * Class name ends in "x", "ch" or "ss": "es" is appended, so a Search class becomes a searches table.
      # * Class name ends in "y" preceded by a consonant or "qu": The "y" is replaced with "ies", so a Category class becomes a categories table. 
      # * Class name ends in "fe": The "fe" is replaced with "ves", so a Wife class becomes a wives table.
      # * Class name ends in "lf" or "rf": The "f" is replaced with "ves", so a Half class becomes a halves table.
      # * Class name ends in "person": The "person" is replaced with "people", so a Salesperson class becomes a salespeople table.
      # * Class name ends in "man": The "man" is replaced with "men", so a Spokesman class becomes a spokesmen table.
      # * Class name ends in "sis": The "i" is replaced with an "e", so a Basis class becomes a bases table.
      # * Class name ends in "tum" or "ium": The "um" is replaced with an "a", so a Datum class becomes a data table.
      # * Class name ends in "child": The "child" is replaced with "children", so a NodeChild class becomes a node_children table.
      # * Class name ends in an "s": No additional characters are added or removed.
      # * Class name doesn't end in "s": An "s" is appended, so a Comment class becomes a comments table.
      # * Class name with word compositions: Compositions are underscored, so CreditCard class becomes a credit_cards table.
      #
      # Additionally, the class-level table_name_prefix is prepended to the table_name and the table_name_suffix is appended.
      # So if you have "myapp_" as a prefix, the table name guess for an Account class becomes "myapp_accounts".
      #
      # You can also overwrite this class method to allow for unguessable links, such as a Mouse class with a link to a
